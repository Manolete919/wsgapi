/**
 * Use this class to change the password stored in the databae from one that is
 * visible as plain text (a security threat) to one that is "hashed". Hashing is
 * a one-way encryption system. Hashes can be generated but cannot be reverse
 * engineered, which is why they are called one-way hashes. Use this class to
 * generate a hashed password, based on the original plain text version, using
 * SHA-256, which is a superior hashing algorithm. Then copy the output from the
 * console and use it to replace what you have in your database.
